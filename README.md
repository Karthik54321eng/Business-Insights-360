**üõ†Ô∏èTools:**

  1)Excel-Data cleaning and transformation, Pivot Table, Power Query.
  
  2)SQL-Data Retrieval, Aggregation, Data Integration.
  
  3)Power BI Desktop -Data Modelling, Dax, Power Query (M Language).
  
**A)üè¨Company Overview:**

AtliQ Hardware (imaginary company) is a rapidly growing electronics company specializing in hardware products, including PC accessories, printers, and more. Over the years, AtliQ has expanded significantly, establishing a strong global presence in key regions such as APAC, North America, Latin America, and the European Union.

**2 Primary sales platforms:**

   1)Brick-and-Mortar Stores ‚Äì Partnering with physical retail outlets like Croma and Best Buy.
   
   2)E-Commerce Platforms ‚Äì Selling through online giants like Amazon and Flipkart.
   
**3 Multiple sales channels:**

   1)Retailers ‚Äì Third-party sellers, both online and offline, that stock and sell AtliQ‚Äôs products.
   
   2)Direct Stores ‚Äì AtliQ‚Äôs own branded stores, where consumers can purchase directly.
   
   3)Distributors ‚Äì In restricted markets like China and South Korea, AtliQ collaborates with large      
    distributors to ensure product availability.
       
Note: AtliQ‚Äôs customers are retailers and distributors, while the consumers are the end users.

**B)üîé Problem Statement:**

AtliQ Hardware (a mock enterprise) faced major losses due to inefficient decision-making caused by scattered Excel sheets. Competitors using advanced analytics gained an edge, leaving AtliQ struggling with outdated methods. To stay competitive, AtliQ launched a data analytics project to make data driven decision making & strategic growth.

**C)üéØProject Objective:**

To develop an intuitive dashboard that delivers actionable insights for finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain teams, along with an executive and key performers view. This will enhance transparency, improve data accessibility, and empower stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions for strategic growth and efficiency.

**D)üõ¢Data Overview:**

**3 Excel files:**

    1)Operating Expenses,
    
    2)Targets (available only for FY 2022),
    
    3)Market Share (limited to the Personal Computer division).
    
**2 databases:**

    1)gdb041:
		
      1.1) Fact tables: fact_forecast_monthly, fact_sales_monthly.
			
      1.2) Dimension tables: dim_customer, dim_market, dim_product.
			
    2)gdb056:
		
      2.1) Supporting tables: freight_cost, gross_price, manufacturing_cost, post_invoice_deductions and pre_invoice_deductions.

 AtliQ‚Äôs fiscal year runs from September to August, and the dataset covers actual sales from  September    1 , 2017, to December 31, 2021.
 
 NOTE: Since this is a bootcamp project, the data files cannot be shared.

**E)üìëImporting data into PowerBi:**

       Imported datasets from MySQL Database to Power BI.

**F)üßπÔ∏èData Cleaning & Transformation**:

**Standardized & Trimmed Data:**

      1)Removed leading and trailing spaces from text fields.
			
      2)Standardized naming conventions for consistency.
			
**Data Structuring & Optimization:**

      1)Created a dim_date table for better time-based analysis.
			
      2)Merged fact_sales_monthly and fact_forecast_monthly into a single table,   fact_actual_estimates, to simplify calculations.
			
      3)Added calculated fields in fact_actual_estimates using data from relevant tables (e.g., deriving pre-invoice deductions using percentage values from the pre_invoice_deductions table).
			
      4)Disabled load for tables that were used to derive calculations in fact_actual_estimates to optimize performance and reduce the Power BI report size.

**G) üõ¢ Data Model:**

        Snowfall data modeling method.

**H)üìë Report Inclusions:**

       Includes a PDF version of the Power BI report,

       2)Certain products, like AQ 5000 Series Electron 9 5900X, AQ MB Elite, and AQ Wi Power Dx1, had zero sales in FY 2022, likely due to demand shifts or outdated models.
			 
**Forecast Accuracy & Supply Chain Efficiency:**

       1)Forecast Accuracy (FCA%) dropped from ~86% (FY 2019) to ~73% (FY 2020) due to COVID-19 disruptions but improved to ~80% (FY 2021) and ~81% (FY 2022).
			 
       2)Excess inventory was a major issue in FY 2019‚ÄìFY 2020, while stock shortages became a challenge in FY 2021‚ÄìFY 2022.

**J)üìù Recommendations:**

       1)Gradually reduce operational and marketing expenses after capturing significant market share to improve Net Profit %.
			 
       2)Shift from flat post-discounting to a performance-based model per product and customer in each market.
			 
       3)Expand distribution and targeted marketing in high-growth region like APAC and in APAC India.
			 
       4)Reevaluate the pricing or cost structure of the Notebook segment to enhance Net Profit %.
			 
       5)Investigate the underperformance of USB flash drives and consider repositioning, discontinuing, or introducing improved models.
			 
       6)Improve forecasting, especially for customers, by leveraging real-time data to minimize stock  imbalances and enhance supply chain efficiency.
			 
       7)Develop targeted strategies to increase market share in North America.
			 
       8)Focus on differentiation to strengthen competitiveness in the PC segment and challenge dominant players like Dale.
